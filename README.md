# reactnativeapp

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   If you use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   Or, with npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the app**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   This will open the Expo Dev Tools in your browser, where you can run the app on an Android/iOS simulator or a physical device using Expo Go.

## Project Structure

- `app/` - Main application code, using [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/).
  - `(auth)/` - Authentication screens (sign-in, sign-up).
  - `(tabs)/` - Main tab screens (home, bookmark, create, profile).
  - `search/` - Search results by query.
  - `_layout.tsx` - Layout files for routing.
- `components/` - Reusable UI components (e.g., `CustomButton`, `FormField`).
- `constants/` - App-wide constants (icons, images, etc.).
